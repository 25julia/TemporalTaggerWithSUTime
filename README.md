# Grails application that parses user birthday with Stanford SUTime library
This project is a simple grails application project which gets the user birthday and displays it in the fomrat YYYY--mm--dd,
parsed with Stanford library [SUTime](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/sutime.html)


## Libraries
For this project we are using Grails framework and [Standford CoreNLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/)

## Problem statement 
The goal is to add custom rules to the SUTime library so we can extend the ability of the library to capture other date formats.
